# TOP-rock-paper-scissors

In this project, I will be making a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript.

After finishing this project, I created a decent looking Rock Paper Scissors game using what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I am quite proud with what I have made because I was able to create this with minimal help from Google, StackOverflow, or W3schools.

Thank you The Odin Project!
